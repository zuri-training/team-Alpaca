## Team-Alpaca-Auth_Wiki

## Introduction

A platform that allows users to have access to authentication codes and interact with communities.

## Project Name: Auth Wiki

Auth_wiki AuthWiki is a Library based platform that serves as a storage for various authentication codes where users can search for codes, read about how they work and how to apply them; as well as have access to download the codes, react and comment once they are registered.

## Project Overview

Authentication is the process of verifying a user or device before allowing access to a system or resources. 
In other words, authentication means confirming that a user is who they say they are. This ensures only those with authorized credentials gain access to secure systems.
Authentication is one of the most common features developers working on web apps are asked to implement, yet it’s also one of the most overlooked ones. 
Building a safe authentication system can become a hard task, time-consuming and requires close attention to details to get it right. To reduce coding time and effort, AuthWiki provides a solution.

## Feature
Documentation:
We’ll be providing the authentication codes for different authentication mechanisms. 
These codes will be available in different programming languages eg JavaScript, Python, etc. 
Each authentication mechanism would have a clear documentation that explains how each authentication mechanism works with available code examples.

Contribution:
Users can register and login on the platform. Registered users can only contribute to the Auth documentation by commenting and/or reacting (like or dislike).

Code download:
Authenticated users would also be able to download complete authentication codes in their programming language of choice for use.
